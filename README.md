## 🛠️ Project Highlights  

### 📊 Data Exploration and Visualization  
- **Dataset**: Processed the Heart Disease dataset, removing anomalies for cleaner analysis.  
- **Key Visualizations**:  
  - Distribution of heart disease cases.  
  - Heart disease occurrence across genders and chest pain types.  
  - Relationships between features like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and target variable.
